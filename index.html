<p>The Boeing 737 MAX 8 is a modern narrow-body airliner 
    capable of carrying from 162 to 210 passengers over a 
    distance of up to 6,570 km. The aircraft has a cruising 
    speed of about 840 km/h and a service ceiling of 12,500 
    meters. The main features of the model are high fuel 
    efficiency and quiet engines, however, the reputation of 
    the aircraft was seriously undermined by defects in the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuvering_Characteristics_Augmentation_System" target="_blank">MCAS system</a>, 
    which led to the crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights 
    in 2018-2019. After the longest flight ban in aviation history and 
    a complete software update, the MAX 8 returned to operation as one 
    of the most proven, but also the most controversial aircraft of our 
    time. The aircraft is also considered one of the most popular airliners.
